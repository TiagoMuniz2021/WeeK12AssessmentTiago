## Homework File: Cloud Security Tiago

Congratulations! You have finished the cloud security portion of the course.
Your homework assignment will be 2 parts:
### Part 1
Cloud computing has many terms and definitions that are unique to the cloud. As such, it is important to understand and remember this jargon when speaking to potential employers or peers.
In part 1 of the homework, our goal is to solidify many of the terms and concepts you have learned throughout the last 4 weeks of class.

#### Instructions

Answer the following questions in your own words:

1.	What are 3 common job roles that combine security and cloud skills?

Cloud Security Analyst, Network Security Analyst and Cloud Solutions Architect 

2.	What are the 3 biggest cloud provider platforms?

Google, Microsoft and Amazon

3.	What are the 6 most common cloud services (and their acronyms)?

SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), DaaS (Desktop-as-a-Service), MaaS (Monitoring as a Service) and DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service)

4.	What is the difference between a virtual network and a physical network?

As the own name already explain the virtual network can be a simple configuration such as VPN and Vlans. A physical network stands more for infrastructure such cabling cat5 or cat6, Fiber or Wi-Fi.

5.	What is the point of setting your first firewall rule to block _all_ traffic?

It is the best practice in cyber security as creating whitelists, blocking all and only allow a specific service/Ip/destination/port.

6.	What is the difference between physical computing components (CPU, RAM, HDD/SSD) and virtual computing components? 

Physical components are real and that said it can host several VMS sharing this physical resource.

7.	What is the purpose of using an encrypted ssh key to connect to a machine?

Creating a more security way to remote access another device using the encrypted authentication from that SSH key.


8.	What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?

Container can host an OS or simple run the application direct on the serve hosting them.
VMs in the other hand need to emulate the shared resource such as CPU, RAM and Hard Drive.

9.	What is a provisioner? Provide 3 examples of common provisioning software.

A provisioner is all steps required to delivery new IT infrastructure, access to data or resources, availability for users and systems. Such as Server provisioning (Azure Virtual Machine), User provisioner (Office 365) and Service provisioning (Azure cloud solution)

10.	What is meant by Infrastructure as Code?

IaC is the process of managing and deploying data centers or Applications trough a machine code instead physical hardware configuration.

11.	What is Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment?

Developers practicing CI (Continuous Integrations) merge their changes on the main branch as often as possible. The developerâ€™s changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. I create a great emphasis on testing automation to check that application is broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.

Continuous delivery/deployment is an extension of CI since it automatically deploys all code changes to a test and/ or production environment after the build stage. In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. 

12.	What is a VPN and when should us use one?

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and most used as to increase security creating a tunnel with encryption between point A to B. You should a client VPN when connecting from home to your office. A stie to site VPN is used between branches. Normal users also can use VPN to avoid Geo blocking for service such as Netflix.

13. What is the purpose of a load balancer?

Load Balancer are used to increase performance by distributing the load equally to the resources.

14. What is a resource group in Azure?	

A resource group can be understanding as a collection of virtual networks, web apps, databases that mean different resources.
 
15. What is Region in Azure?

A collection of datacenters deployed with a latency-defined perimeter and connected trough a dedicated regional low-latency network.
